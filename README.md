# Robocon_2018

This project was a part of the the team which participated in a national level competition in 2018 called Robocon.

Tasks to be completed can be found at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAjVA2u-_1s (For the gist start from 0.37m).One of the videos (Red Team) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4qzogdlhQA You can see me walking behind the automatic robot. I was responsible for programming the automatic robot. The automatic robot has line sensors, encoded motors, proximity sensors and pneumatic actuators.


The code attached is only for the automatic robot.

NOTE : The work on this robot (ncluding finding the suitable mechanism, designing the robot, components, etc.) was done in around 2 and a half months. Naturally, the remaining time was used to program the robot. 

The code uploaded Mark26 is the *final code* used in the competition.

** = Some minor changes were in the arena before the competition, based on the calibration.
